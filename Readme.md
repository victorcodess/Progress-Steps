# Progress Steps

Progress bars are used to show progress of a task. That bar fills up according to the percentage of progress made in accomplishing a task. The "next" button moves you to the next step, while the "prev" button takes you back a previous step.

This is a project form a course by Brad Traversy.

## Lessons Learned

#### CSS
I learn about CSS animations and how to use active pseudo-classes to check when an elemnt is activated by a user. 

#### JavaScript
I learnt a lot about JavaScript DOM manipulations using query selctors and class/id selctors.
I also learnt about event listeners, which were used to check when the user clicks on the next/prev buttons.
